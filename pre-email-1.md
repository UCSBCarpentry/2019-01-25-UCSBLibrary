Dear Carpentry attendee:

Thank you for registering for our UCSB Software Carpentry Workshop.  We are 
looking forward to spending time with you all.

There are several steps we would like you to take before the workshop.  
Most importantly, install all of the software that we will be using.  There are
[detailed setup instuctions](https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/2019-01-25-UCSBLibrary/index.html#setup) 
on the workshop website.

Please also review the [Carpentry Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).  
We are dedicated to creating a respectful and inclusive learning environment for everyone present.  
  
Coffee, tea, and a light breakfast will be served both days.  Lunch on 
Friday will be sandwiches and fruit.  Saturday we will have an array 
of salads.  If you have any specific dietary restrictions, please e-mail 
[mailto://collaboratory@library.ucsb.edu] before 5:00pm Tuesday, January 22.

We will start promptly at 9:00 am each day.  Breakfast will be available starting at 8:30.
If you have problems with software installation or configuration, please arrive promptly at
8:30 and the instructors and helpers will be able to assist you during breakfast.  This is
a hands-on workshop, so having your laptop ready is critical.
