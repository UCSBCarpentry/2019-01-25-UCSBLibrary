  I can lend you mine.
  

I forgot a power adapter. I'm fine for now, but at some point, I'll need to borrow one (Mac).

wikipedia:
The caret was originally and continues to be used in handwritten form as a proofreading mark to indicate where a punctuation mark, word, or phrase should be inserted into a document. The term comes from the Latin caret, "it lacks", from carēre, "to lack; to be separated from; to be free from" <----nice

ASK US QUESTIONS!!

Anyone else having problems with the - and ~ commands on Windows computers? Any suggestions for alternative commands in Windows? Specifically regarding the - for previous and ~ for home directory.
'-' for previous command?  Should be up arrow.
Correct, up arrow will retrieve the most recently run command.  "-" refers to the previous directory only for the cd command
~ for home on Windows = $HOME
so I should type in cd $HOME to get to the home directory? (it also doesn't work) and I was referring to the command cd - or cd ~ in order to get to previous dir or home dir, respectively
Yes, $HOME = home directory, not working for you?
"cannot find the path specified"
I mean, if I type in cd/ it takes me ALL the way to my "home" C:// but that's no fun (unless C:// is what "home" is referring to?
Put up red stickie and I'll take a l

Greg made a handy power point that shows the flow of Git and conflict resolution:

weve seen an issue on osx with rstudio and git, mainly with those who did os updates, it's almost like osx has installed a version of git that doesn't agree with rstudio even though the path is correct. downloading and installing git again and pointing to the new location it installs in will fix it generally (after rstudio restart).

Does anyone know/remember the purpose of creating .gitignore? <- to tell git what to ignore. Things not to look at like password files or large files.<- why/when would you use this in a github repo for data analsyis/sharing, like what Mary was talking about with her real-life examples? <- I use if for every project I do, even if not collaborating with other people. Its a great way for me to manage and backup my code. Okay! So it's like for all the files/data you're not actively working on? Or old versions of your data/analysis? <- things I am actively working on and some that are "finished" and even some that are just dead in the water. I put it all up on github but not necessarily within .gitignore?

This is obnoxious, but is there any way to edit a file within R Studio and save the file within the terminal part of R Studio? Instead of clicking the save button (eye roll) <- dont think so. The file is modified in the GUI memory and I am not sure R Studio has a commannd line interface for the GUI  That's what I was thinking. Since you're editing it in a different location. But then once you save the file in R Studio you can manually push it to github through the terminal if you really want to. <- yep! I find git through terminal is actually easier Thank you!
thanks for sharing!

Is there any way to get around the levels(cats$coat) <- c(levels(cats$coat), "tortoiseshell") requirement for adding new rows that contain factors?
Mary answered it. Here's my code (in case anyone was curious), with a bunch of different iterations to make sure I addressed everything
#create a data frame with my personal information
df<-data.frame(name=c("Amelia"),
               surname=c("Ritger"),
               lucky_number=c(28),
               stringsAsFactors = FALSE) #stringsAsFactors forces "amelia" and "ritger" are not factors
#add coffee as an option
coffee<-c(FALSE)
df<-cbind(df,coffee)
#add my neighbor as an option
df<-rbind(df, c("Sam", "Niday", 11, TRUE))
#add color as an option
color<-c("blue","purple")
df<-cbind(df,color)
#add another neighbor as an option
df$color<-as.character(df$color)
df<-rbind(df, c("Mary","Donovan",2,FALSE,"red"))


One alternative for log transforming values in ggplot is simply to log10 the variable within the ggplot layer (instead of using scale_x_log10):
ggplot(data=data, aes(x=log10(gdpPercap),y=lifeExp,by=country))+
  geom_point(aes(color=continent))
