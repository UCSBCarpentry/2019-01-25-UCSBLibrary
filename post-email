Dear Carpentry attendee:

Thank you so much for participating in our Software Carpentry Workshop this past weekend.  I hope you 
are seeing applications for what you learned in your work.

As we discussed at the end of the day, the UCSB team of Carpentry Instructors has time set aside
twice a week to plan workshops and support learners.  For the remainder of winter quarter, those
will be:
  Tuesdays, 3:00 to 4:30
  Wednesdays, 9:30 to 11:00

Feel free to stop by the Collaboratory and visit with us!

We added a few more URL's to the workshop's etherpad:
  https://pad.carpentries.org/2019-01-25-UCSB-Library
Remember, this will stay around forever, so you can always refer back to it.

Please don't forget to take the Carpentries' post-workshop survey:

If you have friends that want to take the next workshop, here is the website with a 
link to registration for our February 21-22. You are also welcome to attend yourself!

We have a request in to form a @ucsb.edu Google group.  I will send you a registration 
note as soon as that gets set up.

Happy coding!

-your Carpentry team.
